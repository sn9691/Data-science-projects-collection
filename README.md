# About:
Welcome! I'm data scientist and this repository is a collection of all the projects I have ever done to learn and grow in this field.
I started out by teaching myself in my spare time when I was sorking as a software developer; I have now received formal education in the form of PGP certification in Data Science from INSOFE, Hyderabd. Here is a list of all projects I have done till date:
