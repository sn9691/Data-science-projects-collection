# About:
Welcome! I'm data scientist and this repository is a collection of all the projects I have ever done to learn and grow in this field.
I started out by teaching myself in my spare time when I was sorking as a software developer; I have now received formal education in the form of PGP certification in Data Science from INSOFE, Hyderabd. All projects other than the one done in INSOFE were done by me when I was just starting out in this field.

Problem statement: "Flying has been the go-to mode of travel for years now; it is time-saving, affordable, and extremely convenient. According to the FAA, 2,781,971 passengers fly every day in the US, as in June 2019. Passengers reckon that flying is very safe, considering strict inspections are conducted and security measures are taken to avoid and/or mitigate any mishappenings. However, there remain a few chances of unfortunate incidents. Imagine you have been hired by a leading airline. You are required to build Machine Learning models to anticipate and classify the severity of any airplane accident based on past incidents. With this, all airlines, even the entire aviation industry, can predict the severity of airplane accidents caused due to various factors and, correspondingly, have a plan of action to minimize the risk associated with them."

* Predict demand of food products (INSOFE final project Hackathon): End to end data science project required for qualifying in the program completion of INSOFE.

Problem statement: "A large company that manufactures eatables, delivers them through a group of suppliers to retailers of different kinds all over the country. One of the company’s recent sustainable initiatives was to sell eatable products with no preservatives.
These consumables have a shelf life of one week. The company, to ensure the quality of its products on retailers’ shelves, creates a
program to buy back the remaining products on the shelves of the retailers post expiry (one week). This has significantly increased the company’s operation costs and is also affecting its gross margins. The company has hired you as a data science consultant and provides you with 5 weeks of data. You are now supposed to predict the demand for various products across for the next two weeks. You are also supposed to produce a report using your machine learning model and the 5th week’s data as a validation set to analyze the potential loss in revenue / gain in operational costs."
