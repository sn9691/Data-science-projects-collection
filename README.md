# About:
Welcome! I'm data scientist and this repository is a collection of all the projects I have ever done to learn and grow in this field.
I started out by teaching myself in my spare time when I was sorking as a software developer; I have now received formal education in the form of PGP certification in Data Science from INSOFE, Hyderabd. Here is a list of all projects I have done till date:

#### Predict demand of food products (INSOFE final project Hackathon): End to end data science project required for qualifying in the program completion of INSOFE.

Problem statement: "A large company that manufactures eatables, delivers them through a group of suppliers to retailers of different kinds all over the country. One of the companyâ€™s recent sustainable initiatives was to sell eatable products with no preservatives.
These consumables have a shelf life of one week. The company, to ensure the quality of its products on retailers' shelves, creates a
program to buy back the remaining products on the shelves of the retailers post expiry (one week). This has significantly increased the company's operation costs and is also affecting its gross margins. The company has hired you as a data science consultant and provides you with 5 weeks of data. You are now supposed to predict the demand for various products across for the next two weeks."

#### S&P 500 stock data analysis and machine learning
Collected S&P 500 stock data by scraping ticker labels from Wikipedia, analysing stock trends and applying a machine learning algorithm to predict whether to buy stocks or not.
